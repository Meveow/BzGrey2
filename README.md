# BzGrey

BzGrey is a project developed as part of the CP3407 - Advanced Software Engineering course (Assessment Item 2) by Group 3, consisting of Honey Zin, Evelyn Soong, and Lea Annie Bonet.

# Introduction

The proposed solution aims to address two main objectives for elderly patients in hospitals: promoting comfort and familiarity with simple technology and keeping them occupied and engaged during their hospital stay. By developing a user-friendly app, the project aims to provide a supportive environment that encourages elderly patients to embrace technology while also providing entertainment and activities to alleviate feelings of loneliness and boredom. 

# Target Audience

The target audience for this app is elderly patients in hospitals. The app is specifically designed to cater to their needs and ensure ease of use, considering their familiarity with technology may be limited.

# Objectives

1. Comfort with Simple Technology:
User-Friendly Interface: The app will have a clean and intuitive user interface with larger fonts, high contrast colors, and simple navigation. This design approach ensures that elderly patients, regardless of their prior experience with technology, can comfortably use the app.
2. Keeping Patients Occupied and Engaged
Entertainment Options: The app will provide a variety of activities, such as movies and music. These options will cater to the interests and preferences of older adults, ensuring there is something enjoyable and engaging for everyone.
Information and News: The app will offer access to a curated selection of news articles. This feature helps to keep patients informed, engaged, and connected to the outside world.

# Key Features

The BzGrey app includes the following key features:

Patient Information: On the home page of the app, there will be a small button that leads to the patient's information, including their temperature, heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), any drug allergies, name, age, height and weight. This feature allows patients and hospital staff to easily access and monitor the patient's vital information.

Calendar and To-Do Lists: The app will feature a calendar page displaying a 30-day calendar with the year, month, and the current date highlighted. Additionally, there will be a section for to-do lists and upcoming tasks, such as medication reminders or any procedures, with specified times for each task.

Contact Page: The app will include a contact page that displays a list of individuals the patient can contact, such as family members or friends.

Entertainment Page: The app will have an entertainment page that offers three sections. The news section will display top recent and trendy news, keeping the patient informed about current events. The music section will provide a collection of old school classic songs for the patient's enjoyment. The films section will list shows or movies that patients can watch to pass the time.

Note: The app is intentionally kept simple, as the primary responsibility of patient care lies with the hospital staff. The app aims to enhance the hospital experience for elderly patients by providing them with necessary information, entertainment, and the means to stay connected with their loved ones.
